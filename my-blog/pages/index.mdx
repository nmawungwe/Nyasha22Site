Welcome to my website! I'm Nyasha Mawungwe, a chemical engineer, entrepreneur, and tech enthusiast with a passion for sustainable energy and digital innovation.

My journey began at Peterhouse High School, where my fascination with the sciences and mathematics took root. This led me to the University of Cape Town, where I pursued a major in Chemical Engineering. My academic journey didn't stop there, as I further specialized in Sustainable Energy for my master's degree, focusing on green hydrogen produced from electrolysers.

While my academic pursuits were centered around engineering and energy, my time at university also sparked a passion for entrepreneurship. I founded a project called [ WhyNut ] (https://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2017-03-27-why-nut-just-start-somethinga), aimed at promoting healthy eating habits among students. The success of this project was a testament to my ability to initiate and lead impactful ventures.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I used the opportunity to broaden my skill set and delve into the world of computer programming. This self-taught journey opened up a new world of technology for me, and I discovered a passion for creating applications and services that can make a real difference in our lives.

I am a firm believer in the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence. I am confident that AI will revolutionize sectors like education, health, and productivity, and I am excited to be part of this journey.

In addition to AI, I am deeply interested in the potential of cryptocurrencies. I believe that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins will play a significant role in increasing individual digital sovereignty and improving payment efficiency.

On this website, you'll find blog posts where I delve deeper into these topics. I hope to share my insights and engage in meaningful discussions with you.

I am committed to participating in projects that add value to the world. I hope that my work, whether it's in sustainable energy, tech innovation, or entrepreneurship, will contribute positively to our collective future.

Thank you for visiting my site. I look forward to sharing my journey with you..
